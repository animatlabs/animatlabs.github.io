Aah... as it goes, "There's always the first". So, here I am starting the journey with the very first blog I write. I am Animesh, a technologist, and you can find more [about me and this initiative here](../../about).

Having explored multiple platforms to make an expandable and original way of hosting and bringing this initiative to life, had loads of options to sort things out! Finally, ended up basing it all on `GitHub Pages` with `Jekyll` and `Minimal Mistakes`. Loved how the community supports it, so easy to build and with so many customizations available. You might see a page in the future on how you could set up something similar for yourself as well!

Hope to keep exploring and sharing my playground with the larger community of developers. Do follow for the posts that are going to come soon...
