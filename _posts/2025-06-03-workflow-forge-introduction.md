## TL;DR: WorkflowForge in 30 Seconds

**🚀 Performance**: 4-56 μs operations, 15x concurrency scaling  
**💎 Zero Dependencies**: Core package = 0 dependencies, ~50KB  
**🔧 Developer First**: Fluent API with industrial metaphor that makes sense  
**📦 Production Ready**: Available on NuGet with 6 extension packages  
**🛠️ Compensation Built-in**: Automatic saga pattern - no manual orchestration  

```bash
dotnet add package WorkflowForge
```

*That's it. No configuration files. No heavy containers. Just workflows that work.*

## The Problem I Got Tired Of

After years of wrestling with .NET workflow frameworks, I was done with:

- **🐌 Performance that kills under load** - Simple operations taking milliseconds
- **📦 Dependency hell** - Core packages dragging in 20+ dependencies  
- **🧩 Complex setup** - Hours of configuration for basic workflows
- **💸 Memory waste** - Frameworks using MBs for KB worth of logic
- **🔧 Poor abstractions** - APIs that fight against how you think

*Sound familiar?*

Most enterprise workflow solutions are built for workflow *designers*, not developers. They optimize for drag-and-drop editors and XML configurations, not code quality and runtime performance.

**I wanted something different.**

## WorkflowForge: Industrial Strength for Developers

WorkflowForge flips the script. It's built with a **developer-first philosophy**:

- **Start small, scale big** - Zero dependencies in core, optional power when needed
- **Performance obsessed** - Sub-microsecond operations, verified by benchmarks  
- **Intuitive metaphor** - Industrial concepts that map to how workflows actually work
- **Production tested** - Built-in compensation, observability, and resilience patterns

### The Industrial Metaphor That Actually Works

Instead of abstract "engines" and "executors", WorkflowForge uses concepts you intuitively understand:

- **🏭 The Forge** - Factory that creates workflows and components
- **⚒️ Foundries** - Execution environments where real work happens  
- **👨‍🔧 Smiths** - Master craftsmen orchestrating the entire process
- **⚙️ Operations** - Individual tasks that transform your data

*It just makes sense.*

## Performance That Speaks Numbers

**Every claim is backed by BenchmarkDotNet results.** No marketing fluff.

| **Metric** | **WorkflowForge** | **Context** |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Operation Execution** | **4-56 μs** | Per operation overhead |
| **Foundry Creation** | **5-15 μs** | Environment setup |
| **Concurrency Scaling** | **15x improvement** | 16 workflows: 301ms vs 4,540ms sequential |
| **Memory Footprint** | **<2KB per foundry** | Runtime allocation |
| **Package Size** | **~50KB core** | Zero dependencies |

*Test system: Intel Core Ultra 7 165H, .NET 8.0* → **[See Full Benchmark Results](https://github.com/animatlabs/workflow-forge/tree/main/src/benchmarks)**

## Two Ways to Build: Your Choice

### ⚡ Quick & Dirty (Prototyping Mode)

Perfect for rapid prototyping, scripts, or simple automation:

```csharp
using WorkflowForge;

var workflow = WorkflowForge.CreateWorkflow()
    .WithName("ProcessOrder")
    .AddOperation("ValidateOrder", async (order, foundry, ct) => 
    {
        foundry.Logger.LogInformation("Validating order {OrderId}", order.Id);
        return await ValidateOrderAsync(order, ct);
    })
    .AddOperation("ProcessPayment", async (order, foundry, ct) => 
    {
        foundry.Logger.LogInformation("Processing payment for order {OrderId}", order.Id);  
        return await ProcessPaymentAsync(order, ct);
    })
    .Build();

using var foundry = WorkflowForge.CreateFoundry("OrderProcessing");
using var smith = WorkflowForge.CreateSmith();

await smith.ForgeAsync(workflow, order, foundry);
```

### 🏗️ Enterprise-Grade (Production Mode)

Dependency injection, proper separation of concerns, testable operations:

```csharp
// Registration
services.AddScoped<ValidateOrderOperation>();
services.AddScoped<ProcessPaymentOperation>();

// Workflow Definition  
var workflow = WorkflowForge.CreateWorkflow(serviceProvider)
    .WithName("ProcessOrder")
    .AddOperation<ValidateOrderOperation>()
    .AddOperation<ProcessPaymentOperation>()
    .Build();

// Execution
using var foundry = WorkflowForge.CreateFoundry("OrderProcessing");
using var smith = WorkflowForge.CreateSmith();

await smith.ForgeAsync(workflow, order, foundry);
```

---

## Automatic Compensation: Sagas Made Simple

**The killer feature:** Built-in compensation without the complexity.

```csharp
public class ProcessPaymentOperation : IWorkflowOperation
{
    public string Name => "ProcessPayment";
    public bool SupportsRestore => true; // 🔥 This enables automatic compensation

    public async Task<object?> ForgeAsync(object? inputData, IWorkflowFoundry foundry, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var order = (Order)inputData!;
        var paymentResult = await _paymentService.ProcessAsync(order, cancellationToken);
        
        // Store compensation data
        foundry.SetProperty("TransactionId", paymentResult.TransactionId);
        return order;
    }

    public async Task RestoreAsync(object? outputData, IWorkflowFoundry foundry, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // 🎯 Called automatically if downstream operations fail
        var transactionId = foundry.GetProperty<string>("TransactionId");
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(transactionId))
        {
            await _paymentService.RefundAsync(transactionId, cancellationToken);
        }
    }
}
```

**That's it.** No saga coordinators. No state machines. No XML. When something fails downstream, WorkflowForge automatically calls `RestoreAsync` on completed operations in reverse order.

*Finally, compensation that doesn't require a PhD in distributed systems.*
