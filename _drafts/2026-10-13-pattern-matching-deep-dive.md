<!--
ORIGINALITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Have I used pattern matching extensively in real projects?
- [ ] Are the code examples tested and demonstrate real-world scenarios?
- [ ] Do I provide unique insights beyond basic documentation?
- [ ] Have I compared performance implications of different patterns?
- [ ] Are the recommendations based on actual experience?

## Introduction

<!-- TODO: Introduce pattern matching:
- Evolution from C# 7.0 to current version
- Why pattern matching matters
- When to use it vs traditional approaches
- Overview of what we'll cover
-->

## Type Patterns

<!-- TODO: Explain type patterns:
- Basic type checking and casting
- Pattern matching with is expressions
- Type patterns in switch expressions
- Performance considerations
- Code examples showing before/after
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## Property Patterns

<!-- TODO: Cover property patterns:
- Matching on object properties
- Nested property patterns
- Combining with type patterns
- Real-world use cases
- Examples with domain models
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## Positional Patterns

<!-- TODO: Explain positional patterns:
- Deconstructing records and tuples
- Positional matching syntax
- When to use positional vs property patterns
- Examples with records
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## List Patterns

<!-- TODO: Cover list patterns:
- Matching on arrays and lists
- Slice patterns
- Recursive patterns
- Practical examples
- Performance implications
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## Recommendations

<!-- TODO: Provide practical guidance:
- When to use each pattern type
- Performance considerations
- Readability vs conciseness trade-offs
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Best practices from experience
-->

## Conclusion

<!-- TODO: Summarize key takeaways:
- Pattern matching as a powerful tool
- When it improves code quality
- Future considerations
-->
