<!-- 
POST PLAN:
- What is RAG and why it matters
- Architecture: Embed -> Store -> Retrieve -> Generate
- Document chunking strategies
- Embedding with Ollama (nomic-embed-text)
- Vector storage (in-memory for simplicity, mention pgvector)
- Semantic search implementation
- Augmented generation with context injection
- Build a "Ask your codebase" tool
- Performance and quality tips

UNIQUE ANGLE: Full RAG pipeline in C# without Python. Local-first with Ollama.

## The Architecture

```
Documents → Chunking → Embeddings → Vector Store
                                         ↓
User Query → Embedding → Similarity Search → Context + LLM → Answer
```
