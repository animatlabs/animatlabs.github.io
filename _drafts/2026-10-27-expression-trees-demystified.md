<!--
ORIGINALITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Have I built expression trees in production code?
- [ ] Are the examples tested and working?
- [ ] Do I explain the internals clearly?
- [ ] Have I covered performance implications?
- [ ] Are the EF Core integration examples accurate?

## Introduction

<!-- TODO: Introduce expression trees:
- What they are and why they matter
- The connection to LINQ and IQueryable
- Why EF Core uses them
- Overview of what we'll cover
-->

## What Are Expression Trees

<!-- TODO: Explain expression trees:
- Definition and purpose
- Difference between expressions and delegates
- How they represent code as data
- The Expression<T> type
- Visual representation examples
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## Building Expressions

<!-- TODO: Cover building expressions:
- Manual expression tree construction
- Using Expression API
- Common patterns
- Combining expressions
- Debugging expression trees
- Code examples
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## Use Cases

<!-- TODO: Discuss use cases:
- Dynamic query building
- Translating to other languages (SQL, etc.)
- Code generation scenarios
- Reflection alternatives
- Real-world examples
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## EF Core Integration

<!-- TODO: Explain EF Core integration:
- How EF Core uses expression trees
- IQueryable vs IEnumerable
- Query translation process
- Performance implications
- Common pitfalls
- Examples with EF Core
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## Conclusion

<!-- TODO: Summarize:
- Key concepts
- When to use expression trees
- Performance considerations
- Best practices
-->
