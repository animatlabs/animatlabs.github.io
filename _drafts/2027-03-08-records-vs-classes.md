<!--
ORIGINALITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Have I used records extensively in production?
- [ ] Are the comparisons based on real-world experience?
- [ ] Have I benchmarked performance differences?
- [ ] Do I provide clear decision criteria?
- [ ] Are the examples from actual projects?

TARGET: 1,500-1,800 words

## Introduction

<!-- TODO: Introduce records:
- What records are and why they were introduced
- The problem they solve
- When C# 9.0 introduced them
- Overview of what we'll cover
-->

## Records Basics

<!-- TODO: Explain records fundamentals:
- Record syntax and features
- Value-based equality
- Immutability by default
- With expressions
- Positional records
- Code examples
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## Records vs Classes Comparison

<!-- TODO: Compare records and classes:
- When to use records
- When to use classes
- Key differences
- Value equality vs reference equality
- Mutability considerations
- Inheritance differences
- Code examples showing both approaches
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## Performance Considerations

<!-- TODO: Discuss performance:
- Memory implications
- Equality comparison performance
- Allocation patterns
- When records are faster/slower
- Benchmark examples
- Real-world performance data
-->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example code
```

## Recommendations

<!-- TODO: Provide guidance:
- Decision criteria for choosing records vs classes
- Common patterns and use cases
- Migration strategies
- Best practices
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Real-world examples
-->

## Conclusion

<!-- TODO: Summarize:
- Key takeaways
- When records shine
- When classes are still better
- Future considerations
-->
