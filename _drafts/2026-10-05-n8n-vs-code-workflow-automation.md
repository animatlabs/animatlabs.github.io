<!-- 
POST PLAN:
- n8n overview (60k+ stars, visual workflow builder)
- The "build vs buy" decision for workflows
- When visual tools win (marketing, ops, non-developers)
- When code wins (complex logic, testing, versioning, performance)
- Comparison matrix: n8n vs Elsa vs WorkflowForge vs custom code
- Hybrid approach: n8n for orchestration, code for business logic
- Running n8n self-hosted with Docker
- WorkflowForge for code-first workflows
- Decision framework with specific criteria
- Real-world scenarios

UNIQUE ANGLE: Positions WorkflowForge as the "build" answer while being fair to n8n.
PROMOTION STRATEGY: Fair comparison drives traffic. Mention WF GitHub link naturally.
