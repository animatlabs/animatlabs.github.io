# Blog Publishing Schedule

**65 drafts | Weekly on Mondays | Feb 2026 - May 2027**

> **Local-First Approach:** All posts can be developed and tested locally with Docker. No Azure, AWS, or cloud subscriptions required. See `docker-compose.azure-local.yml` for the complete local development stack.

> **Content Strategy:** Every post has a unique angle - opinionated take, real benchmarks, library discovery, problem-solving narrative, or fun/visual content. No generic docs rewrites.
