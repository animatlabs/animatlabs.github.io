POST PLAN:
- Both libraries solve workflow orchestration in .NET
- Elsa 3.0 overview (7.5k stars, visual designer, activity-based)
- WorkflowForge overview (code-first, lightweight, extensible)
- Architecture comparison (Elsa: activity-based vs WF: pipeline-based)
- Feature matrix table
- Performance benchmarks (startup time, memory, throughput)
- When to use Elsa (visual designers, complex branching, enterprise)
- When to use WorkflowForge (code-first, lightweight, library integration)
- Migration paths between the two
- Honest assessment of trade-offs
