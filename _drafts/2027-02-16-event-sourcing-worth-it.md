## What is Event Sourcing

<!-- TODO: Explain event sourcing concept, how it differs from traditional CRUD, event store -->

```csharp
// TODO: Add event sourcing example
```

## Benefits and Costs

<!-- TODO: Benefits: audit trail, time travel, scalability. Costs: complexity, storage, learning curve -->

## When It Makes Sense

<!-- TODO: Scenarios where event sourcing shines: financial systems, audit requirements, complex domains -->

## Simpler Alternatives

<!-- TODO: When traditional approaches are better, audit logging alternatives, change tracking patterns -->

```csharp
// TODO: Add simpler alternative examples
```

## Conclusion
