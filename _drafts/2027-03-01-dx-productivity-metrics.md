## The Measurement Problem

"We need to measure developer productivity."

The wrong response: count commits, PRs, or lines of code.

The right response: understand what outcomes you're actually trying to drive.

<!--
TARGET: 2,000-2,500 words

OUTLINE:
1. Why traditional metrics fail (Goodhart's Law, gaming)
2. DORA metrics explained
3. SPACE framework
4. DX Core 4 (combines DORA + SPACE + DevEx)
5. What to actually measure
6. How to use metrics for improvement (not punishment)
7. The developer experience component

CONCEPTS:
- Outcome vs activity metrics
- Diagnostic vs improvement metrics
- Developer self-reported data

## Why Traditional Metrics Fail

<!-- TODO: Lines of code, commits, PRs - all gameable -->

## DORA Metrics

The four key metrics from the State of DevOps research:

| Metric | What It Measures | Elite Benchmark |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Deployment Frequency | How often you deploy | On-demand |
| Lead Time for Changes | Commit to production | < 1 hour |
| Change Failure Rate | Deployments causing issues | < 5% |
| Time to Restore | Recovery from failures | < 1 hour |

## SPACE Framework

- **S**atisfaction and well-being
- **P**erformance (outcomes, not activity)
- **A**ctivity (but with context)
- **C**ommunication and collaboration
- **E**fficiency and flow

## DX Core 4

The unified framework combining DORA, SPACE, and DevEx:

1. **Speed** - Real velocity and deployment frequency
2. **Effectiveness** - Working on high-value initiatives
3. **Quality** - Reliability and maintainability
4. **Business Impact** - Engineering work → organizational outcomes

## What to Actually Measure

### Outcome Metrics (Monthly)

<!-- TODO: Strategic indicators -->

### Improvement Metrics (Weekly)

<!-- TODO: Actionable, team-controlled -->

## The Developer Experience Component

<!-- TODO: Survey-based data, combining quantitative and qualitative -->

```
Key questions:
- How often do you have uninterrupted focus time?
- How long does it take to get a code review?
- How easy is it to find information you need?
- How confident are you in deploying changes?
```

## Using Metrics for Improvement

<!-- TODO: Diagnostic tool, not performance review -->

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Measuring activity, not outcomes**
2. **Using metrics for individual evaluation**
3. **Not combining system data with developer feedback**
4. **Collecting data but not acting on it**

## Conclusion

<!-- TODO: Metrics should drive improvement, not punishment -->
