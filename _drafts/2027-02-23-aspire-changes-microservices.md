<!--
TARGET: 1,200-1,500 words
ORIGINALITY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Clear comparison of microservices development before and after Aspire
- [ ] Specific examples of what Aspire simplifies (service discovery, configuration, observability)
- [ ] What still requires manual work or architectural decisions
- [ ] Practical migration considerations and patterns
- [ ] Real-world code examples showing the difference
-->

## Before Aspire

<!-- TODO: Describe the traditional microservices setup challenges -->
<!-- TODO: Service discovery complexity, configuration management, observability setup -->
<!-- TODO: Manual orchestration, health checks, distributed tracing setup -->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example of traditional microservices setup without Aspire
// TODO: Show service discovery code, configuration management, health checks
```

## With Aspire

<!-- TODO: How Aspire changes the development experience -->
<!-- TODO: Service discovery automation, unified configuration, built-in observability -->
<!-- TODO: Developer dashboard, simplified service communication -->

```csharp
// TODO: Add example of same microservices setup with Aspire
// TODO: Show simplified service registration and communication
```

## What You Still Need

<!-- TODO: Architectural decisions that Aspire doesn't solve -->
<!-- TODO: Domain boundaries, data consistency patterns, deployment strategies -->
<!-- TODO: Business logic organization, error handling strategies -->

```csharp
// TODO: Add examples of what still requires architectural decisions
```

## Migration Considerations

<!-- TODO: Steps to migrate existing microservices to Aspire -->
<!-- TODO: Incremental adoption strategies, compatibility concerns -->
<!-- TODO: Team training and process changes -->

```csharp
// TODO: Add migration examples and patterns
```

## Conclusion
