POST PLAN:
- The idea: AI-powered code review in minimal code
- Setup: Semantic Kernel + Ollama (or any LLM)
- KernelFunction plugins for code analysis
- Prompt engineering for code review
- Reading diff/files programmatically
- The 50-line implementation
- Sample output on real code
- Extending: security checks, style enforcement, complexity analysis
- Integration ideas: GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks

UNIQUE ANGLE: Viral-format "in N lines" post. Practical, impressive, shareable.
